        <p>
            Just random things could make me the happiest,
             it could be the gentle wind brushing past or just the way it rains or snows. 
             It could be how someone just laughs till they are out of breath. 
             Meeting a lott amazing people and talking to them is among my favs as they even help me 
             improve myself as an individual and to know how humans work as they r diverse too. 
             Be it online or in real life, new souls always excite me and it's always good to surround 
             yourselves with lovable people.

        <h1 class="headings">I LOVE</h1>
        <p>
            Music and art are something i love the most. When i say art it could include just everything,
             from the way people smile to the way they just simply exist, everything is an art after all.
              Music has always been my safe home and i believe there are certain emotions that could only
               be conveyed through music. I love making video edits of my favorite idols and shows and that 
               just makes me immensely happy.

        <p>
            I'm very social and outgoing but there are some anti social moments too lol 
             but I'm punctual and doesn't like to keep things pending and like to keep things pretty and
              organised. I  have some basic knowledge in c++, python and java. As a person always with a 
              thirst to learn and improve,i would love to learn and explore more. I would love to work hard
               and give my best for this club.
